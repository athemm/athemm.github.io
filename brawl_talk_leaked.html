<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">Hey guys, my name is Ryan. I'm a community manager for Brawl Stars at Supercell and today, I have some news. 
<br>
Brawl Stars will be shutting down it's servers and get discontinued at 24th December and all players will be able to transfer their in-game purchases to other live Supercell games.
<br>
All players during the last week of Brawl Stars will receive 5000 gems to spend and enjoy. Thanks for supporting us until the very end of this game and we hope we'll see you again in another project<a>
