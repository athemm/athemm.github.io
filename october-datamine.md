### Map Making Contests

According to the files, there will be Map Contests in-game in which you can submit your map and if it wins, it will be added in-game

#### How it works:

1 - You can submit a map / maps (I don't know if you can only submit one or not) you made if there's a map contest going on.
<br>
2 - After you submit your map, it will be reviewed and approved for publication (this is probably so nonsense maps would not make it into voting). <br>THIS IS ALSO CALLED "greenlighting"
<br>
3 - Once your map is approved, you will be able to publish your map.
<br>
4 - After your map is published players will be able to vote it.
<br>
5 - Winners get announced
<br>
You can also report maps for inappropriate content. These maps can get banned from the contest
<br>
