<p><strong>New Brawler - Stu! </strong>Stu used to be a crash test bot in Starr Park, but since the audience loved to see him crash, Stu then became a stunt driver extraordinaire with gasoline in his veins! He makes a big entrance, burning serious rubber all over the stage. He is a Trophy Road Brawler unlocking at 10.000 Trophies! </p>

<li><strong>Main Attack: Razzle Dazzle </strong>- Stu fires out two pyrotechnic shots that pack quite a wallop!</li>

<li><strong>Super Ability: Nitro Boost </strong>- Hitting an opponent with Razzle Dazzle charges up Stuâ€™s Nitro Boost. A short dash that bumps 
opponents out of the way. Leaves a trail of burning rubber on the ground that will set fire to any opponents that touch it.</li> 

<li><strong>Gadget: Speed Zone -</strong> Stu drops a booster that makes himself and his teammates move faster inside its area of effect.</li>
